# Watch

This web application allows users to authenticate with their GitHub account and view information about the pull requests they are involved in. Users can filter PRs by status, such as "needs review", "approved", and "changes requested".

In addition to viewing pull request information, users can also view a timeline of important activities in the repositories they are watching. 

We also plan to include Jira integration, which will display tasks that the user has to complete in Jira.
